However, what we can say for sure is: We're doing our best. We rely on organic cotton, recycled polyester and are in the process of further minimizing our environmental impact. As we also take social responsibility seriously, we closely examine our supply chain and working conditions.\nBy producing timeless sportswear that doesn’t go out of fashion, we can also avoid overproduction of clothing. For transportation, we primarily use ships, as they are more environmentally friendly than airplanes. Only in emergencies 1% do we use a plane. The high quality of our products makes them particularly durable, saving you many purchases. For us, being sustainable mainly means developing a product that can be used for a long time."

Our production outside of Germany primarily enables us to offer affordable prices to create basics for everyone, and this can be done fairly. It would be rash to completely withdraw our orders and thus take away the work from these factories. International standards ensure that everything in our production is above board.\nThrough long-standing relationships, we have established a responsible supply chain and are committed to fair working conditions and decent wages in our production facilities. We work closely with our production partners to ensure that social and environmental standards are met. Sustainability is a holistic approach that goes beyond the location of production and encompasses the entire supply chain."
